# Anti Crypto theses

## 1
 - Blockchain != Crypto - Blockchain is the underlying tech
   - Ignores permissioned vs permissionless - leans towards permissioned and therefore hierarchy
   - Are you proposing people only use "private" / permissioned chains (do not have tokens) instead of permissionless / "public" chains (do have tokens)?
     - Circular argument: back to governance => how to enforce this?
   - Fine, then how can you have a permissionless (public) blockchain without a token to reward Miners/Stakers?
   - Convo with Copilot:
     - Blockchain is the infrastructure; cryptocurrency involves the tokenomics within that strucutre.
     - "Can you give any examples of permissionless chains that do not have a token?"
       - Answer: None 
     - VS.
     - "Are there any public chains that do not classify as Cryptocurrencies?"
       - Answer: Filecoin and Golem
     - Seperation: Governance tokens.

## 2
 - Bitcoin has no intrinsic value
   - Ignores secure yet digital, decentralised aka peer to peer and distributed nature of crypto - see king of the hills.
 - Bitcoin is a hype cycle.
   - Doesn't acknowledge that Bitcoin must be earned
 - The output of Bitcoin is not measurable AKA Bitcoin relies on belief.
   - Doesn't acknowledge electricity as being tangible and thus Bitcoin has no tangibility.

## 3
 - Computer Code cannot be objectively verified therefore: Bitcoin nodes do not secure the network by expending electricity and no value is created in the mining process.
 - Digital Private keys cannot generate tangible value and therefore are not connected to the mining process.
   - So because we can't touch the human soul therefore it also does not exist and is equally indistinguishable from the next?

## 4
 - Bitcoin is not new - "Its real value is comparable to coins in computer games".
   - Can these supposedly comparable ledgers also handle _**asynchronous**_ transactions (out of band/offline? - DB locks and mid air collisions)? Can people fork or download a copy of these ledgers without compromising their security?
 - Bitcoin and Eth only have value becuase they were first
 - Cryptos are interchangeable with other cryptos
   - Soul, neurological program running on your brain, call it whatever you want but you cannot be "you" without it.
 - Bitcoin is not legal or recognised as legal tender
   - What is a signature and how do signatures hold up the legal framework?
 - Bitcoin is a scam or pyramid scheme
   - Where driver / admin key? 

# Repeats

 - The value of Bitcoin is completely subjective because it is digital and electricity is intangible and thus it is impossible to objectively quantify it's value or any other facts about any particular Blockchain
 - Because the value is completely subjective, the security is illusionary / Security of the network is a facade because the value of Bitcoin is completely subjective.


# Repeats but in convo form:

 - @nopfen "same without the paper" and this is because all cryptos are interchangeable with other cryptos and the cost of their creation can be disassociated from their chain of creation?
 - I don't understand how you believe the fundamentals of crypto are enough to justify that it's not a scam.
 - @duckmasterflexTo answer your question as simply as possible: because seizure of coin from a wallet address is impossible and because maintenance of the governing ruleset is open source and can be forked or migrated by anyone and updated by potentially anyone.
 - @mephisto0815 only the person/s that have the private key for the wallet can move whatever is inside it....
 - @demeics For Crypto to be a scam/Ponzi there has to be a lie and a swindler. Where's the lie and who's the swindler?
If you're going to say the swindler is the person I bought my crypto from then you do realise that BTC has to be earned for helping to secure the transactions and not created at will?
 - @realnaps ...You do realise that all Bitcoin is created as a "block reward" it must be earned - hence the moniker "mining".
 - @mundmoriginal so digital is worse than paper because there's no legal precedent for art "ownership" verified by digital signature? If a lawyer can work from home why can't a judge and jury?
Check out Aragon.org
 - @mephisto0815 the URL is just where you view the contents of the NFT, an NFT is an ownership "placeholder" that resides in your wallet and you can transfer to whomever you wish.
Intellectual property is pervasive and abstract, its "ownership" is a legal precedent that requires enforcement.
 - @asylius Or is it perhaps, that you expect _*ALL*_ Blockchains to be exhaustive (like proving a negative) and prevent people from uploading NFTs that are similar or could be a human law infringement?
 - @Unknown Indeed it can't do "magical" stuff but what are you asking from it right there: that it be able to connect some user specific / contextual metadata that exists offchain to some onchain transaction i.e. User phone number -> onchain Address? How do you even prove that I am me? Best way we have for doing that is what do you know, and what do you have?
 - @Unknown If you're buying an art piece from an undoxed address that turns up multiple lookalike pieces on Google image search then maybe you're the problem.
 - @Unknown Anything on the blockchain is public record, Blockchain tracks control not uniqueness.
 - @siednon NFTs are merely "control" placeholders transferred to you on the blockchain (Like BTC but not the same as BTC) by an artist, giving you control over the data (not limited to images) you have in your wallet.
Originality and authorship is solved by connecting the artist's social media presence to their blockchain wallet address (aka verification).
 - @c_dia NFTs are kind of like tracking cookies, they bare testimony of who has interacted with a piece of information. They take the form of a token which an "owner" bares in their cryptocurrency wallet.
Unlike Crypto Coins (plain DB entries) when minted they may have a "payload" which may be artwork or some other important "Transferable" information.
 - @Unknown One of the reasons art has value is because of it's history, identifying the real one is important and they have processes to do that.
 - @Unknown Art is to reflection as data is to self
Which means provenance is indeed important but within a context... and that's the point, the context can be whatever you want it to be it's up to you to meld it into whatever you want it to be...
Valuations will always vary, what's the problem?
 - @Unknown provenance is an important feature of blockchain but it is a subset of identity, i.e. we are able to identify and track each "brush stroke" (or on chain each transaction) and when we step back we are able to piece together the bigger picture and thereby 'peer into the identity' of the painter themselves...
NFTs are a way of tracking digital ownership of the artwork and it's value as a sector is independent of any singular piece of art that is being hosted on the blockchain. 
 - @Unknown Blockchain is to current art authentication as Brush stroke analysis is to the authentication process itself, ie it is 1 component but it's the latest and greatest... 
One always has to look at the picture as a whole when investing...?
 - @gracewillow "legal texts" are all good and well if you have the money to pay for guns and man power.
In BTC that 'manpower'/electricity is dedicated to ensuring the security of the transactions.
 - @wizz3862 to reiterate my question: How does one ignore the fact that electricity literally powers everything about us as human beings, and not accept that it can give rise to something that is just as well defined and distinct from us as sentient beings, as we are from each other?
 - @wizz3862 don't you see the electron is what binds us... Makes all of this possible, our lives are merely a reorganisation of the patterns they've been making throughout time...
 - @wizz3862 Blockchain is just another reorganisation, but one we can all have a copy of without destroying its integrity and one we can all verify to make sure there are no cheats...
